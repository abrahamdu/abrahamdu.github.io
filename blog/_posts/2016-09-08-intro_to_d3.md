When surfing on the Internet, I am always fascinated by animated, interactive graphs, such as __[TheUpshot](http://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot)__ of *New York Times* and __[Information Graphics](http://postgraphics.tumblr.com/)__ of *Washington Post*. As a die-hard coder, the next natural question to me is: which tool(s) do they use to create these fancy graphs? After researching, I was still not 100% sure of answers since they use various kinds of tools but [D3] [1] comes to my eyes.

__1. What is [D3] [1]?__   
-------------------------  

![alt text](/img/blog/d3.png)  

[D3] [1], Data-Driven Documents, is a _JavaScript_ library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualization by implementing front-end triplets, HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It is hosted on [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/d3/d3) as an open source project and maintained/contributed by its creator Mike Bostock and other contributors. According to [GitHub ranking](https://github-ranking.com/), it is ranked as one of top 5 repositories as of September 8, 2016. The first release as on February 18, 2011.

__2. Key Features__   
-------------------------  

One of the key features of [D3] [1] is to bind the data to DOM (Document Object Model) and apply data-driven transformation to the document which eventually generates visualization on web browsers. In this way, large data sets are bound to _SVG_ object with associated properties (shape, color, values) and behaviors (transitions, events) and users can easily apply CSS to style them for final visualization. 

__3. How to Use [D3] [1]__  
---------------------  

There are two ways to include [D3] [1] into our project: offline and online.  

```javascript  
## Offline Option
<script src="../d3.v4.min.js"></script>

## Online Option
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
```  
Starting from version 4.0, [D3] [1] allows user to standalone microlibraries. For example,  

```javascript
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-selection.v1.min.js"></script>
```  
For the whole list of modules, please refer to [D3] [1] [GitHub project page]([https://github.com/d3]).
