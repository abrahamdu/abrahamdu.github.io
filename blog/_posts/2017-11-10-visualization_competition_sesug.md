This year's SESUG was again hosted at the home of [SAS] [1] in Cary. This is my second time to go to this conference. Last time was 2012 and it was also in Cary. Just co-incidence!  

Before going there, I find out there is a visualization competition sponsored by the conference and later during the conference, [Barbara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-okerson-9436a55/) told me that was the first visualization competition in SESUG history. After some study of visualization in the past, especially in the area of [D3] [2], I think I can take this opportunity to try the graph function by [SAS] [1] which I never tried before. Here is something I eventually came up:

I had a good time during the whole conference like my first time in 2012. I saved this as my footprint to SESUG although I didn't win the competition.
