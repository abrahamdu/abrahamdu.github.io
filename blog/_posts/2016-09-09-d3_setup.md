Since [D3] [1] is a JavaScript library, essentially working on [D3] [1] project is a process of working on HTML/CSS/JavaScript together on the web. For me with no background/experience in front-end development, the learning curve is quite steep. There are so many prerequisites we need to study before really putting hands on [D3] [1].

__1. Text Editor__  
-------------------  
Each programmer will have their own preference on code editor when writing codes, sometimes depending on which language they are using. Specifically to [D3] [1], there are several options available.

(1a). [CodePen] [2]  
It allows to create "pens" which are sets of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for testing out bugs, displaying those "pens" on your profile and collaborating with others in the community, taking feedback.

(2a). [JSFiddle] [3]  
Similar as [CodePen] [2], [JSFiddle] [3] provides an integrated user interface for writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes for previewing, debugging and sharing.

(3a). [Bl.ock Builder] [4]  
Unlike [CodePen] [2] or [JSFiddle] [3], [Bl.ock Builder] [4] is created by Ian Johnson solely for sharing [D3] [1] examples. It is an in-browser code editor by loading a GitHub gist. It didn't have different pane windows separated for HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes as [CodePen] [2] or [JSFiddle] [3] did. Instead, it has an *index.html* which contains all front-end codes necessary for [D3] [1] examples, a *README.md* and *thumbnail.png*.

As a matter of fact, majority of [D3] [1] experts, including *[Mike Bostock](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)* himself, all use [Bl.ock Builder] [4] to present their work.  

(4a). Other Local Editors  
The three editors introduced above are so-called on-line editors. You can also choose off-line editors. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) are popular for their excellence in syntax highlight, and web design friendly. I personally use [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).  

__2. Basic Template__  
---------------------  
If you really check a [D3] [1] project ([for example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7322386)), you will find it is a piece of codes mixed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In light of this, you will need to manage HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, DOM (Document Object Model), SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and Canvas. Instead of going through a full introduction of each of them, I rather start with a template with basic functions and I will use this template as a starting point and tweak, add or modify it for different examples in the next series of blogs.  

```javascript  
<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<style>

</style>

<div>

</div>

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
<script>

</script>
```
